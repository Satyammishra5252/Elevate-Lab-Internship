When building a sales dashboard in Power BI using the Superstore dataset, you can create a variety of charts to get a 360° view of performance. Start with KPI cards for Total Sales and Profit, then use a line chart to show Sales vs Profit trends over time (using Order Date, Sales, and Profit). A bar chart for Sales by Category or Sub-Category and another for Top Products by Sales or Profit highlights which items drive revenue. For customer insights, you can plot Sales by Segment with a donut chart and Top Customers with a bar chart. A map for Sales by State or Profit by Region gives a geographical view, while Orders by Ship Mode can be visualized with a pie chart. To analyze shipping efficiency, calculate Delivery Days — if you’re in Power Query, use Duration.Days([Ship Date] - [Order Date]), and if you’re in DAX, use DATEDIFF([Order Date],[Ship Date],DAY) — then plot a histogram to see how long deliveries take. Finally, add profitability analysis with a bar chart of Profit Margin by Category (Profit / Sales), highlight loss-making products, and connect with the Returns table to calculate Return Rate by Category.
